*** Instructions (Ongoing, Once The Set-Up Is Complete) ***
** Instructions For The Developer **

All of below is done in the terminal.
Before running these commands, you will need to cd into the folder that contains the local copy of your repo. It is probably called <private repo name>.

A. When you have completed a feature or when you need to back up or to transfer to another machine:
      git checkout main; git status;  ... git add <new files>; ... git commit -a -m "<nice message>"; git push

   Alternatively, you can use GitHub Desktop to do this (but make sure you are using correct branch).

B. When the the tests run and git status is clean, and you have commited it all into main, merge main branch (remote branch, not the local one) -> toFork:
      git checkout toFork; git merge --squash main; git push; git checkout main

C. When toFork on <private repo name> is satisfactory (whatever it means in your case)
      git checkout toFork; git push public_repo; git checkout main

** Instructions For The User **

D. In the browser, to get the latest updates (it is advised to commit all local changes before you continue):
         - navigate to https://github.com/<user account name>/<forked repo name>, 
         - press "Fetch Upstream" (this button is under the green Code button), 
         - to confirm, press "Fetch and merge" in the menu that will appear just underneath.

*** Developer Set-Up ***

**  Using github.com Web Interface **

1.1. Create a PRIVATE repository, add .gitignore, a license and a README file if relevant.
1.2. commit. This will create a repository with a single branch called main, it will be a default branch on <private repo name>.
1.3. create a branch ToFork using a drop-down menu that will appear when you press on the name of branch main.

1.4. Create a PUBLIC repository, add .gitignore, a license and a README file if relevant.
1.5. <public repo>->Settings -> Branches, rename main branch into toFork branch.

**  Using terminal on your machine **

2.1. Navigate (cd) to a folder that will contain the local copy of the repository.
2.2. From the terminal, run 
        git clone https://github.com/<dev account name>/<private repo name>.git
     This will create a folder called <private repo name> that contains the contents of your repository.
     You can now add more files, commit etc.
2.3. cd into the folder that contains the local copy of your repo. It is probably called <private repo name>.
2.4. To be able to push your changes into the public repository in the futue, run 
        git remote add public_repo https://github.com/<dev account name>/<public repo name>.git
2.5. Run 
        gut remote -v
     to make sure that public_repo is among your origins.

*** User Set-Up ***

** User's Repository (Private or Private) **

3.1. In the browser, open https://github.com/<dev account name>/<public repo name>;
3.2. Press the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the screen.
