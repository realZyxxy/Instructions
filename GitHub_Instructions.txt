*** Instructions (Ongoing, Once The Set-Up Is Complete) ***
** Instructions For The Developer **

All of below is done in the terminal.
Before running these commands, you will need to cd into the folder that contains the local copy of your repo. It is probably called <private repo name>.

A. When you have completed a feature or when you need to back up or to transfer to another machine:
      git checkout main; git status;  ... git add <new files>; ... git commit -a -m "<nice message>"; git push
B. When the the tests run and git status is clean:
      git checkout toFork; git merge --squash main; git push; git checkout main
C. When toFork on <private repo name> is satisfactory (whatever it means in your case)
      git checkout toFork; git push public_repo; git checkout main

** Instructions For The User **

D. In the browser, to get the latest updates (it is advised to commit all local changes before you continue):
         - navigate to https://github.com/<user account name>/<forked repo name>, 
         - press "Fetch Upstream" (this button is under the green Code button), 
         - to confirm, press "Fetch and merge" in the menu that will appear.
